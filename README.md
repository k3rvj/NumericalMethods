# Numerical Methods

Java codes to solve various problems such as equations, system of equations, derivatives, integrals, among others with numerical methods.

### Additional

These codes will be improved as I test new functions, I will also add new solutions to other problems with the help of numerical methods.

### Disclaimer
These methods may contain errors since they were only tested with a few functions. I should add that these algorithms are not the most efficient ones either, as they were developed from my notes taken during my numerical methods class.
